This résumé was adapted from [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

#### Set Up

1. To set up LaTeX: `brew install mactex texmaker`. If these commands do not work you can download and install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) and [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html) the old-fashioned way.
1. Open evan-johnson-resume.tex in texmaker.
1. Use `LuaLaTeX` to run and produce `evan-johnson-resume.pdf`. Also you need to have evan-johnson-resume.tex open to properly compile the PDF. If you are viewing a section file it will not work.
1. Each section of the resume is stored in separate files in the `sections` folder.
